# ConnOS-Simple-Linux-Shell
A very simple Linux shell, originally written as part of a project for an Operating Systems class. Showcases multiprocessing, system calls, and a little bit of error handling.

# Setup
To use, you must first edit the .connrc file. The first line of .connrc is the prompt. Lines underneath are possible paths to your bin folder - if your bin folder is not in one of the paths already listed, you must replace one of the lines or add it below.

Then, compile and run the C file.
